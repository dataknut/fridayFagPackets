# fridayFagPackets

A repo for our [fridayFagPacket](https://energy.soton.ac.uk/friday-fag-packets/) data notes (numbers that could have been done on the back of one and should probably come with a similar health warning).

 * docs - where we (usually) keep outputs - these are published on [energy.soton](https://energy.soton.ac.uk/friday-fag-packets/)
 * data - where we keep (public) data we used
 * R - where we keep useful R code for use across the repo
