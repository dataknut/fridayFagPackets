# fridayFagPackets

A repo for our fridayFagPacket data notes (numbers that could have been done on the back of one and should probably come with a similar health warning).

> git.soton does not support pages so for best viewing try [github](https://dataknut.github.io/fridayFagPackets/).

 * docs - where we (usually) keep outputs - published on [energy.soton](https://energy.soton.ac.uk/news-from-eccd/)
 * data - where we keep (public) data we used
 * R - where we keep useful R code for use across the repo
